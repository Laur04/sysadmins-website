    The Student Systems Administrators are a group of students who maintain computer equipment in the TJ Computer Systems Lab. 
    We run services which power the entire school's operations, including the TJ Website [tjhsst.edu](https://tjhsst.edu), 
    TJ Email accounts (@tjhsst.edu), and a student-run and developed project known as the TJ Intranet [ion.tjhsst.edu](https://ion.tjhsst.edu), 
    which is used daily by students and staff and runs the Eighth Period student activity program. 
    Sysadmins manage over 30 servers and 50 student workstations, all powered by GNU/Linux and open source software.
