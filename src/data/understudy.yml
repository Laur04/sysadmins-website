    The TJHSST Understudy program provides an opportunity for motivated students to gain experience in a real-world networked environment.

    Utilizing the resources provided by generous donors, we maintain the computing resources in TJ's Computer Systems Lab (CSL).
    
    ## Timeline
    This year, the Sysadmin Understudy program is composed of four stages.

    **Interest Sessions**

    Up until around February 14th, we will hold interest sessions for all those interested in the program. During this session, we will give a brief overview of the program.

    If you continue to be interested in the program, please fill out the following Google Form when we post it, so we can gauge interest in the next stage.

    *Scheduled Sessions (Tentative)*

    Do not sign up for more than one interest session because all information will be repeated.

    * Feb. 7, B block
    * Feb. 12, B block
    * Feb. 14, B block

    **Shadow Sessions**

    Following the interest sessions, we will have around two weeks where you will have the opportunity to "shadow" a current Sysadmin.

    *Scheduled Sessions (Tentative)*

    Do not sign up for more than one shadow session.

    * Feb. 19, B block
    * Feb. 21, B block
    * Feb. 26, B block

    TBD

    **Application & Selection**

    Following work sessions, in a process to be determined, we will accept applications for the next class of Sysadmins.
    
    ## Frequently Asked Questions
    
    ### General

    **What technical skills to qualify to be an understudy?**

    None! You do need a strong willingness to learn.

    **Do we "hack"?**

    In the context of our work, "hacking" is using technical knowledge to overcome problems. In that respect, we hack to fix problems & make our services work.

    ### Expected Conduct
    
    **What are the expectations for technology use?**

    The CSL is part of TJHSST with all conduct regulated by appropriate school regulations, including the FCPS Acceptable Use Policy.
    
    Although experimentation within the confines of acceptable behavior for legitimate academically-related purposes is an inevitable part of the Lab's operations, activities that lead to
    * compromise of CSL systems
    * compromise of user data
    * interference with CSL operations
    * unauthorized access on any systems
    * or any other improper result are expressly prohibited.
    are expressly prohibited.

    The Student Systems Administrators, CSL Lab Directors, and the school supervise all activity within the Lab, and any technology usage incompatible with the rules will be handled with both technical, disciplinary, and legal consequences.


    **What are the expectations for conduct within the Lab?**
    
    As described above, all school rules apply within the Lab. Access to unauthorized areas of the Lab, including but not limited to the machine room or storage rooms, without appropriate permission is prohibited.

    As an Understudy, you *do not have the authority* of a full Student Systems Administrator. You may not represent yourself as a Sysadmin or representative of the Computer Systems Lab.
