    As part of the TJHSST Computer Systems Lab (CSL or SysLab), the Student Systems Administrators (Sysadmins or SysAdmins), a group of volunteer students, maintain various computing resources and services for the school.

    The Student Systems Administrator Understudy program (for short, Sysadmin Understudy Program) is the training program for the full Student Systems Administrators program. We aim to identify and develop talent that can sustain and enhance the long legacy of the Sysadmin program and productively enhance the Lab and school.
    
    ## Timeline
    This year, the Sysadmin Understudy program is composed of four stages.

    ### Interest Sessions

    Up until around February 14th, we will hold interest sessions for all those interested in the program. During this session, we will give a brief overview of the program.

    If you continue to be interested in the program, please fill out the [following Google Form](https://forms.gle/zs5Xfm6gBKfJXCr79), so we can gauge interest in the next stage.

    *Scheduled Sessions (Tentative)*

    Do not sign up for more than one interest session because all information will be repeated.

    * Feb. 7, B block
    * Feb. 12, B block
    * Feb. 14, B block

    ### Shadow Sessions

    Following the interest sessions, we will have around two weeks where you will have the opportunity to "shadow" a current Sysadmin.

    **Eighth period blocks should open by the end of President's Day Weekend, as we are assessing the best possible schedule based on form responses.**

    *Scheduled Sessions (Tentative)*

    Do not sign up for more than one shadow session.

    * Feb. 19, B block
    * Feb. 21, B block
    * Feb. 26, B block
    * Feb. 28, B block

    ### Work Sessions

    Following the shadow sessions, you will get mini-tasks that help you get some hands-on experience with some of what we do.

    *Scheduled Sessions*

    TBD

    **Application & Selection**

    Following work sessions, we will accept applications for the next class of Sysadmins.
    
    ## Frequently Asked Questions
    
    ### General

    **What do I need in order to become an Understudy?**

    You need to be an active, enrolled **TJ student**, preferably a current freshman or sophomore. We consider juniors, but the bar for them is much higher than others.

    In addition, due to the nature of our work, you need to have **strong character**.

    ## Learning/Understudy

    **What technical skills to qualify to be an Understudy?**

    _None!_ You do need a strong willingness to learn.

    ## Sysadmins

    **What qualities do successful Sysadmins have?**

    To reiterate, _we do not at all expect close to complete technical knowledge in order to become an Understudy_. The current senior Sysadmins had nowhere as much experience as they do now. We do expect you, however, to be extremely willing to learn and experiment on your own, since the skills we use are not something that can be learned via a math formula, textbook, or lecture. Instead, they come from practice, experimentation, research, and dedication, and the Sysadmin program provides an opportunity to do just that.

    Based on our experiences, having a strong foundation in these areas is quite important:
    - Problem Solving - Problems can pop up in everything we do and are sometimes highly unusual. Our capacity to solve them
    - Debugging skills - Whether it is debugging a vexing code error or performance issue, being able to effectively debug issues is quite important to what we do.
    - Linux - Installing, running, and configuring a Linux distro (especially a DYI distribution like Arch Linux) teaches you quite a lot.
    - Scripting - If you are running Linux, you might.
    - Programming - Being able to write good, clean code is at the heart of what we do. We mostly use Python, but knowing one language, like Java, C, or C++, makes learning others much easier.
    - Git - We use Git _a lot_, so it is nice to get comfortable working with it regularly, with an especial focus on effective branch rebasing. One good way to learn is to start using it to store your code from school classes.
    - Computer Basics - It is very useful to know the basics of computers, like what RAM, CPUs, operating systems, Windows, Linux, and Mac OS is.
    - Typing - We type a lot, so being able to type quickly is just nice.

    **What specifically do Sysadmins do?**

    The Lab functions similarly to a small-to-mid sized business with all the needed work that accompanies that. As a result, in addition to maintaining a significant number of publicly-facing services, we need to maintain and improve the many non-public systems that support them.

    Some of the primary areas that our work falls under include (in no particular order of importance):
      - **Systems Administration** - upgrading, maintaining, & patching our Linux servers & related services
      - **Incident Response** - quickly responding & resolving issues that arise in the Lab
      - **Network Administration** - designing, configuring, & maintaining our relatively-large computer network and associated devices
      - **Database Administration** - designing & administering databases; optimizing database performance
      - **Automation** - designing & developing software to automate tasks and the configuration of our systems
      - **Web Development** - developing services exposed on the Internet (primarily backend with Django with some work in frontend and graphic design)
      - **Monitoring** - developing & designing tooling to monitor our services for issues
      - **Security** - reviewing our software & systems for security vulnerabilities; developing software/processes/architecture to prevent security vulnerabilities
      - **Performance** - making our code/systems faster & more efficient
      - **Documentation** - writing down how our infrastructure is set up to pass down to future generations of Sysadmins
      - **Technical Support** - responding to in-person and electronic questions from the broader TJ community
      - **Hardware Maintenance** - building, configuring, & constantly hardware to support the Lab
      - **Infrastructure Design** - designing good architectures for scalable, efficient, and effective systems & software
      - **Project Management** - managing & allocating tasks within the team

    **Do we "hack"?**

    In the context of our work, "hacking" is using technical knowledge to overcome problems. In that respect, we hack to fix problems & make our services work.

    **Do Sysadmins get to choose what they work on?**

    While we try to pair strengths & interests with work, Sysadmins have to be accommodating to
    changing priorities and demands. However, that does not mean that a Sysadmin will stop
    working in area that interest them, since we have a lot of overlap between areas.
    
    For example, if a Sysadmin is responsible for web development on Ion and securing Ion becomes
    a higher priority, the Sysadmin would need to prioritize work on finding security
    issues in our codebase instead of developing new features. At the same time,
    however, the Sysadmin would be able to continue doing web development, just in a different form.

    Another example would be, if a Sysadmins is working with building hardware and monitoring
    of that system's hardware needs to be done, the Sysadmin would be able to work with
    hardware, just in a different form by extracting metrics from hardware.

    Ultimately, Sysadmins need to be comfortable working with computers and computer software,
    regardless of what form that takes, because we cannot avoid changing priorities.

    ### Process

    **How are Sysadmins selected?**

    Successful applicants into the Sysadmin program are active participants in the Understudy program and acquire skills (both in and outside of the program) that would be useful as a contributing Sysadmin. Based on an application we will release near the end of the year, we will admit students as full Sysadmins based on a variety of factors with a goal of identifying students who would contribute productively to the program, Lab, and school. Some of these factors include:
    * degree of participation in the Understudy program
    * demonstrated willingness to learn
    * demonstrated technical skills valuable to the program
    * demonstrated Sysadmin aptitude
    * commitment to the program
    * strong character

    ### Expected Conduct
    
    **What are the expectations for technology use?**

    One of the reasons the CSL exists is to provide a learning environment for TJ students,
    and, as a result, students have relative freedom. In exchange for the relative freedom
    to experiment, we expect all users to behave as responsible digital citizens and
    respect boundaries, rules, the Lab, and other users, both within and outside the Lab.
    
    Alll conduct is regulated by appropriate school regulations, including the
    FCPS Acceptable Use Policy. Prohibited activities include those that lead to:
    * compromise of CSL systems
    * compromise of user data
    * interference with CSL operations
    * unauthorized access on any systems
    * harm to the Lab, school, or others
    * or any other improper result

    The Student Systems Administrators, CSL Lab Directors, TJHSST Technology Team,
    and the school supervise all activity within the Lab, and any technology
    usage incompatible with the rules will be subject to appropriate
    technical, disciplinary, and legal consequences.

    **What are the expectations for conduct within the Lab?**
    
    As described above, all school rules apply within the Lab.
    Access to unauthorized areas of the Lab, including but not limited to the
    machine room or storage rooms, without appropriate permission is prohibited.
    As an Understudy, you *do not have the authority* of a full Student
    Systems Administrator. As a result, you may not represent yourself
    as a Sysadmin or other representative of the Computer Systems Lab.

    or reach out to a Student Systems Administrator.
    
    ## Announcements
    
    - **02/09/2020**: Thank you for your interest in the Sysadmin Understudy program!
      If you are interested in continuing in the process, please fill out the
      following Google form by the end of this week (https://forms.gle/zs5Xfm6gBKfJXCr79).
      We will use this form to gauge overall interest in the program beyond these initial interest sessions.

    - **02/15/2020**: We are now ready to open signups for the shadow sessions.

    We will have four B block (or, if interest surpasses that, more) sessions:
    Wed. Feb. 19, Fri. Feb. 21, Wed. Feb 26, Fri, Feb 28. They each will have a
    capacity of 7 (or more, at our discretion), so that we can have a closer
    interaction. In order to give an equal opportunity for all students to
    shadow, do NOT sign up for more than *one* of the Sysadmin Understudy
    sessions scheduled on those days. If you sign up for one and later
    find out you can't show up, please switch out in order to give someone
    else a chance.

      The shadow sessions will be a block where you will have the opportunity to
      "shadow" current Sysadmins and see a snapshot of what we do. We will also
      offer a server room tour, since we couldn't feasibly do that during
      30-person interest sessions. You will also have the opportunity to ask
      questions one-on-one with current Sysadmins and get a bigger deep-dive
      into some of the technologies we use.

      As a disclaimer, the work we do during the shadow sessions does not necessarily
      fully represent all of our work, but we hope it gives you good insight.

      Following the shadow sessions, we will ask you to fill out a Google Form,
      so we can learn a little bit more about you and your interests,
