# Website - Sysadmins

Official website of Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology's systems administrator team.

## Architecture

The sysadmins' site is built using React and Gatsby. Markdown files serves as the content management system.

## Development

1. Start the server

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

2. Edit code

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
